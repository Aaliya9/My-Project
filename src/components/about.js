    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hi, I'm Aaliya Sharif, a passionate software engineer with a strong focus on front-end development, although I am also skilled in back-end technologies. I specialize in creating responsive, user-friendly websites and applications using technologies like React, JavaScript, and the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular/React, Node.js). 
    </p>
    <p>
      I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science Engineering in 2020. During my academic journey, I gained a solid foundation in software development, algorithms, and problem-solving. I also completed an internship at S2P EduTech, where I worked as a MEAN Stack Developer, building and maintaining web applications.
    </p>
    <p>
      My passion for coding and problem-solving drives me to constantly learn and improve my skills. I enjoy collaborating with teams to create innovative solutions and am always eager to take on new challenges. When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, or working on personal projects to sharpen my skills.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm always looking for opportunities to grow as a developer and contribute to impactful projects. Feel free to connect with me if you'd like to collaborate or learn more about my work.
